- question: "Why Copan?"
  answer: "Copan is a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/129/) and one of the most important ancient Maya cities. It was the capital of a major Maya kingdom from the 5th to 9th centuries and is famous for its stunning sculptural art and the Hieroglyphic Stairway - the longest known Maya text. We wanted our guests to experience somewhere truly unique and unforgettable."

- question: "How do I get to Copan Ruinas?"
